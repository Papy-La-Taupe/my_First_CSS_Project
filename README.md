# my_First_CSS_Project
T.O.P. end of CSS segment project

This project is to code however we please, but the end-game is determined, it's semi-free, but a good CSS-tinkering experience.

It's also very close to what is needed from a real-world webpage, so the obtained and used skills will prove themselves useful.

Since it's a learning project, I will, as always from now on, try to add my own touch in the way I resolve the problem at hand.

However, since the goal here isn't to reinvent the wheel and risk going overboard, this time I will just try to make a code that i like, and will still like in 6 month wwith more experience, like "ok, clearly i'm way better now, but it wasn't half bad anyway".

It's not about a best practice anything, it's only to test my own understanding of CSS writing.

I personnaly don't think "small code = best practice" (like, at all) but this is a good opportunity to use it.

I want the result to be responsive, and the header and footer to always show.

The rest of the work will depend on where I'm going along the way.
